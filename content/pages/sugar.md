ICUMSA 45 Sugar
===============

At SLJ Trading Company LLC, we operate in the real world of sugar trading, aligning with market realities to ensure efficient, reliable transactions for serious buyers. Our focus is on securing sustainable supply from Brazil and select alternative markets, giving our buyers the flexibility to meet their procurement needs without unnecessary delays.

### Strategic Focus: Brazil & Key Global Markets

Brazil remains the worldâ€™s largest sugar exporter, producing over 60% VHP bulk sugar, which is refined abroad. However, we recognize that diversification is key to ensuring reliability and competitive pricing. SLJ Trading Company LLC provides access to:

*   âœ… **Brazilian Sugar** â€“ VHP bulk, IC10, and IC180+, sourced from leading suppliers.
*   âœ… **Indian & Thai Sugar (Selective Supply)** â€“ Alternative sources for refined sugar, subject to market conditions and government regulations.
*   âœ… **Central American & European Sugar (Specialized Orders)** â€“ For buyers seeking alternative origins, where viable.

Our approach is not about chasing every market, but rather about matching buyers with the most effective and reliable sources.

### For Serious Buyers Only: Financial Capacity Matters

Securing sugar from Brazil or any global supplier requires verifiable financial strength. To move forward, buyers must present:

*   âœ” Proven financial capability (bank guarantees, transaction history, etc.)
*   âœ” Clear purchase intent, aligned with market realities
*   âœ” Willingness to structure pricing with included commissions, as most suppliers do not pay broker fees directly

### Commission Structure: Transparency in Pricing

Unlike conventional commodity markets, Brazilian sugar mills do not pay strong commissions, and in many cases, do not pay them at all. Commission structures must be built into the deal, with clear understanding from all parties. Buyers expecting a separate commission structure must be prepared to include it within the pricing model.

### Access to Major Suppliers: Brazil & Beyond

SLJ Trading Company LLC works directly with major global sugar suppliers, ensuring access to:

*   âœ… **Leading Brazilian Mills** â€“ Reliable supply of VHP bulk sugar and refined grades.
*   âœ… **Selective Indian, Thai, and Central American Mills** â€“ Alternative refined sugar supply options for buyers with flexible sourcing requirements.

### We Deliver Real Solutions â€“ No Speculation, Only Execution

At SLJ Trading Company LLC, we align buyers with actual supply, structure deals efficiently, and ensure smooth execution. If your company is a serious buyer with verifiable financial capacity, letâ€™s move forward.
